# Overview of this training materail

This program will teach you best practices in data science project management and how to appyly them to research project. 
This material will help you to manage a research project that comprise some *online collaborative working*,
has a relatively *big team, where people have complementary skills*,
use *coding or programming*, as well as the *reuse of code*,
and last but not least, aim at producing a *reproducible analysis*.

Here we give an short overview of the topics that will be covered in this couse.
