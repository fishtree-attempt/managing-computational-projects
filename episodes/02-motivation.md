## Starting with Scientific Process

In reproducible scientific research, someone should be able to look at your work and understand in detail what was done and why. Those wishing to reproduce your work would have the means to do so. Guiding principles aside, there are also selfish reasons for reproducible workflows and records of critical decision points.

And so, whether due to mistakes or extending projects, *"anything you do you will probably have to be done again"*. [^murphy] Despite few life scientists having formal training in computer science, the majority of research now requires computational methods, whether creating a figure, testing a model, or training a neural network. As a group leader, there is a responsibility to ensure your team creates modular and reproducible workflows whether they are working in a lab or in RStudio. 

As things stand, published papers should  the logic behind generating hypotheses and experimental designs are ideally shared in the Introduction section of a publication. Data collection protocols are shared through Methodology sections in published papers. Some lab workflows are shared globally and become universal. However, the steps involved with data processing/analyses are not transparent:

## Understanding this process in computational projects

- What challenges and issues exist
- Identify components for project management 
- Approach: We will use the workflow shown in the image to guide interactive session to find different components in each stage of research (design stage - experiment - data analysis - publication), this will be revisited in the beginning of each chapter to show where we are in that workflow/process when talking about a new concept/practice
