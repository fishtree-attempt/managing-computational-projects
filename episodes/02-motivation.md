## Starting with Scientific Process

Question - hypothesis testing (method selection) - lab method (implementation) - analysis and measurement - publication (design stage - experiment - data analysis - publication)
*Add image describing how it looks like in biosciences*

## Understanding this process in computational projects

- What challenges and issues exist
- Identify components for project management 
- Approach: We will use the workflow shown in the image to guide interactive session to find different components in each stage of research (design stage - experiment - data analysis - publication), this will be revisited in the beginning of each chapter to show where we are in that workflow/process when talking about a new concept/practice
