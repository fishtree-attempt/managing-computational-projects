## Data Science for Biomedical Scientists

Over the last decade, several training materials and computational resources have been developed for early career researchers to learn about and apply data science approaches in their work. However, to ensure that there is a shared understanding at the leadership and decision-making levels, there is a need to engage and educate senior researchers on these concepts. We believe that targeted measures and opportunities for researchers who work as supervisors and research advisors can help them build a better understanding of data science and good practices for reproducible research in their work.

Specifically in biomedical research and related fields, there is growing demand to accessibly communicate the importance and application of data science, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML), so that senior researchers can make informed decisions around their application.

The **Data Science for Biomedical Scientists** project helps address this gap in training by equipping experimental biomedical scientists with the computational skills essential for carrying out meaningful analyses of research datasets through data exploration, management, and visualisation. We aim to present unfamiliar or complex material to biologists in a relatable and easily accessible way. Although the training course is tailored to the biomedical sciences community, materials will be generally transferable and directly relevant for data science projects across different domains.

## Masterclasses for Modular and Flexible Learning

We have adopted a modular format, covering a range of topics and integrating real-world examples that should engage senior researchers who are often short in time. The goal is to provide an overview (without diving into technical details) of (1) data science and AI/ML practices that could be relevant to life science domains and (2) good practices for handling open reproducible computational data science.

The following masterclasses are part of this project that provide a collection of modular episodes covering topics across overarching themes:

-   Introduction to data science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, AI (Under development)
-   Managing and supervising computational Projects (Current Lesson)

Each lesson is supplemented with technical resources and learning opportunities that can be used by senior researchers in guiding the learning and application of skills by other researchers in their team.

## Target audience

Experimental biologists and biomedical research communities, with a focus on two key professional/career groups:

1.  Group leaders without prior experience with Data Science and ML/AI - interested in understanding the potential additionality and application in their areas of expertise
2.  Postdoc/Lab scientists – next-generation senior leaders - interested in additionality, but also the group more likely to benefit from tools to equip them with the requirements to enable the integration of computational science into biosciences

## Pre-requisites and Assumptions

In defining the scope of this project, we make the following assumptions about the learner groups, which can be considered pre-requisites for this training:

- Our learners have a good understanding of designing or contributing to a scientific project throughout its lifecycle
- They have identified a computational project with specific questions that will help them reflect on the skills, practices and technical concepts discussed in this training
- This training doesn't cover processes of designing a research proposal, managing grant/funding or evaluating ethical considerations for research. However, we assume that learners have a computational project in mind for which funding and research ethics have been approved and comprehensive documentation capturing this information is available to share with the research team.
- We also assume that the research team of any size is (either partially or fully) established.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this masterclass, attendees will gain a better understanding of:

-  designing computational projects using collaborative, reproducible and open science approaches
-  examining challenges and potential pitfalls in applying best practices in Data Science
-  identifying tools and practices required for managing specific kinds of computational projects
-  applying a systematic framework introducing computational protocols in their groups as project leads and/or managers

## Mode of delivery

Each masterclass has been developed on separate repositories as standalone training materials but will be linked and cross-referenced for completeness. This modularity will allow researchers to dip in and out of the training materials and take advantage of a flexible self-paced learning format.

In the future, these materials could be coupled with pre-recorded introduction and training videos (to be hosted on the Turing online learning platform - details TBA).

They can also be delivered by trainers and domain experts, who can mix and match episodes from across the two masterclasses and present them in an interactive workshop format.

## Next Steps after this Training

After this training we recommend our learners take these next steps:

-   Go through the "Introduction to Data Science and AI for senior researchers" if not already completed
-   Explore the set of resources provided at the end of each episode for deeper dive into various technical topics required to learn or guide the application of Data and computational research best practices in real-world projects
-   Establish connections with other training and training materials offered by The Alan Turing Institute, The Crick Institute, The Carpentries, The Turing Way and other projects/organisations involved in the maintenance and development of this training material
-   Connect with other research communities and projects in open research, data science and AI that offers opportunities to develop/enhance technical skills
-   Collaborate with domain experts such as librarians, research software engineers, community managers, statisticians or people with specialised skills in your organisation who can provide specific support in your project.

## Funding and Collaboration

Data Science for Biomedical Scientists is funded by The Alan Turing Institute's [AI for Science and Government](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/asg) (ASG) Research Programme. It is an extension of [The Crick-Turing Biomedical Data Science Awards](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/crick-turing-biomedical-data-science-awards) that strongly indicated an urgent need to provide introductory resources for data science in bioscience researchers. This project extension will leverage strategic engagement between Turing's data science community and Crick's biosciences communities.

Pulling together existing training materials, infrastructure support and domain expertise from [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/), [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), [Open Life Science](https://openlifesci.org/) and the [Turing ‘omics interest group](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/omics-data-generation-and-analysis-group), we will design and deliver a resource that is accessible and comprehensible for the biomedical and wet-lab biology researchers.

This project will build on two main focus areas of the Turing Institute's [AI for Science and Government](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/asg) research programmes: good data science practice; and effective communication to stakeholders. In building this project, we will integrate the [Tools, practices and systems](https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/tools-practices-and-systems-open-leadership-team-call-volunteering) (TPS) Research Programme’s core values: build trustworthy systems; embed transparent reporting practices; promote inclusive interoperable design; maintain ethical integrity and encourage respectful co-creation.
