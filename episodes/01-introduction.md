# Target audience:

Experimental biologists and biomedical research communities, with a focus on two key professional/career groups:

1. Group leaders without prior experience with Data Science and ML/AI - interested in understanding the potential additionality and application in their areas of expertise
2. Postdoc/Lab scientists â€“ next-generation senior leaders - interested in additionality, but also the group more likely to benefit from tools to equip them with the requirements to enable the integration of computational science into biosciences

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of these masterclasses, attendees will gain a better understanding of:

- designing computational projects using collaborative, reproducible and open science approaches 
- examining challenges and potential pitfalls in applying best practices in Data Science
- identifying tools and practices required for managing specific kinds of computational projects
- applying a systematic framework introducing computational protocols in their groups as project leads and/or managers

## Next Steps after this Training

After this training we recommend our learners take these next steps:
- Go through the "Introduction to Data Science and AI for senior researchers" if not already completed 
- Explore the set of resources provided at the end of each episode for deeper dive into various technical topics required to learn or guide the application of Data and computational research best practices in real-world projects
-  Establish connections with other training and training materials offered by The Alan Turing Institute, The Crick Institute, The Carpentries, The Turing Way and other projects/organisations involved in the maintenance and development of this training material
- Connect with other research communities and projects in open research, data science and AI that offers opportunities to develop/enhance technical skills
- Collaborate with domain experts such as librarians, research software engineers, community managers, statisticians or people with specialised skills in your organisation who can provide specific support in your project.

## Pre-requisites and Assumptions 
- You bring a comprehensive experience of designing or contributing to a scientific project throughout its lifecycle 
- You have identified a computational project with specific questions that will help you reflect on the skills, practices and technical concepts discussed in this training
- This training doesn't cover processes of designing a research proposal, managing grant/funding or evaluating ethical considerations for research. However, we assume that learners have a computational project in mind for which funding and research ethics have been approved and comprehensive documentation capturing this information is available to share with the research team.
- We also assume that the research team (either partially or fully) has been established.
