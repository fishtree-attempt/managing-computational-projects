# Research Data Management

Research Data Management (RDM) covers how research data can be stored, described and reused. Data here is used as a generic term to encompass all digital objects. RDM is a vital part of enabling reproducible research. 
RDM ensures efficiency in research workflows, and also greater reach and impact, as data become FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable). 
Data should be stored in multiple locations and backed-up regularly to prevent loss or data corruption. 
Clearly describing data using documentation and metadata ensures that others know how to access, use and reuse your data, and also enable conditions for sharing and publishing data to be outlined.

> ## Why This is Useful
>
> Managing your data allows you to always find your data and ensure the quality of scientific practice.
> Storing your data properly and and backing-up regularly prevents data loss.
> It can help with recognition for all research outputs.
> It stimulates collaboration with others, who will find it easier to understand and reuse your data.
> RDM is cost/time efficient, as you will always be able to find and use your data.

## Defining Data

Data are objects that you use and produce during your research life cycle, encompassing data
sets, software, code, workflow, models, figures, tables, images and videos, interviews, articles. Data are your research asset. 
A good way of thinking about what might be classed as data that needs to be managed is to ask yourself the questions: 
- What is the information that I need to use and write about in my paper or book?
- What information would I need to back up my conclusions?
- What information is needed by others to understand and possibly replicate the research that I have done?
This information is your data.

## The Research Data Lifecycle - A Model for Data Management

Research data often follows a ‘lifecycle’ which follows the research project as it evolves. This model provides a sound basis on which to plan for research data management, from data creation at the start of a research project, through to publishing and sharing research at the end of the project, and archiving any research data for the long-term and future re-use once the project has ended.

The research data lifecycle involves data creation, data use, data publication and sharing, data archiving, and data re-use or destruction. However, data have a longer lifespan than the research project that creates them. In a Data Management Plan you can structure how you will manage and share your research data.

## Data Management Plan

A Data Management Plan (DMP), or Output Management Plan, is a document that describes how your research outputs will be generated, stored, used and shared within your project. A DMP is a living document, which can be updated throughout the research project as needed.

A Data Management Plan is a roadmap for you to manage your data efficiently and securely. This can prevent data loss or breaches. Planning ahead on how to manage your data consistently can save you time later on!

### A Data Management Plan should provide information on five main topics

1. Roles and Responsibilities
2. Type and size of data collected and documentation/metadata generated
3. Type of data storage used and back up procedures that are in place
4. Preservation of the research outputs after the project
5. Reuse of your research outputs by others
