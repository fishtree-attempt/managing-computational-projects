## Collaborative Research Practices

- Functional programming (approach for reproducibility)
- Reproducible environment
- Literate programming: Jupyter Notebook
- Binderise your repo


### Code Review

- 1:1 and lab meetings
- Narrating code and software steps (documentation, pseudocode, describing how to run the code) 
- Asynchronous vs synchronous


> [Turing Way: Code Reviewing Process](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/reviewing.html)

> *Code review is often done in pairs, with each reviewer also having some of their code reviewed by their partner. Doing this can help programmers to see and discuss issues and alternative approaches to tasks, and to learn new tips and tricks.*
>
> *A simple objective of the review process is to catch bugs and elementary errors.*
>
> *Code review provides another pair of eyes to consider whether the documentation provided along with the proposed code changes is fit-for-purpose.*
>
> *Code review can also help to ensure that code is readable and easy to understand.* 
>
> *Reviewing code in small chunks incrementally as the project is developing can help make the code review process a lot more efficient.* 
>
> *Don’t review more than 400 lines of code (LOC) at a time, less than 200 LOC is better. Don’t review more than 500 LOC/hour*

> *Petre, Marian, and Greg Wilson. "Code review for and by scientists: preliminary findings." (2014).*
>
> *Scientists are very aware that their understanding of code dissipates over time and that this is a large hidden cost. Equally, they suspect that they spend a lot of time reinventing wheels. They may not know how code review will help with that, but they hope that it will.* 
>
> *One of the mentors expected scientists to overhaul complete code bases. The advice from one mentor was cogent: if you check the docstring and write a test every time you touch a method, the code improvements will accumulate over time with minimal effort.*

> [Code Reviews: the Lab Meeting for Code, F. Perez](http://fperez.org/py4science/code_reviews.html)
>
> *Someone who isn’t intimately involved with your project should understand from the module documentation and the comments what you are trying to do, what approach you’re taking, and why they should expect it to work.*
>
> *Take some time to prepare a presentation about your code that will answer the above questions even for someone who hasn’t read the code. You’re more likely to get useful feedback, rather than nitpicking about syntax, if the audience can see the big picture.*
>
> *Keep it a safe environment, i.e. make sure chastising is relatively gentle even when deserved (but do point out when code doesn’t meet the required standard – frame it as a learning experience though).*


### Group Code Review and Writing

- Code presentations
- Hackathon
- Documentation sprint
- Sharing burden for knowledge exchange and support

> [Turing Way: Recommendations for Code Reviewing](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/reviewing/reviewing-recommend.html)
>
> *Unlike traditional, “academic-style” peer review, most code review systems have a number of advantages: they’re rarely anonymous, they’re public-facing, and without the middleman of an editor, contact between reviewer and reviewee can be direct and rapid. This means code review is typically a fast, flexible, and interactive process.*
