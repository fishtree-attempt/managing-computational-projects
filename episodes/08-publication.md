## Publications

While the output of research projects is usually centred around publishing a journal article, this format of science communication and knowledge sharing is increasingly restrictive with the new ways scientific research is conducted. The requirements from journals themselves is also expanding, you are now often asked to upload data sets and code as part of your publication. Releasing data is increasingly a requirement from funding bodies, and outputs from research groups can go beyond a single paper, releasing tools and methods that can be used worldwide.


## Code release

For computational projects, releasing your work in an open repository has parallels with publications. However, unlike a publication, open repositories do not need to be a finalised piece.

For some research groups however, there are specific requirements to keep their work private and so open access repositories are unsuitable for work in progress. See the section below for good and not so good reasons for keeping code private.

It can therefore be more appropriate to release the code associated with a research article as a static series of files. If your project follows the directory template introduced in a previous episode, for example:

You could bundle folders into a `.zip` file and upload it to Zenodo.

### Zenodo

> Zenodo is a general-purpose open-access repository developed under the European OpenAIRE program and operated by CERN. It allows researchers to deposit research papers, data sets, research software, reports, and any other research related digital artefacts.
>
> Uploads to Zenodo are:
>
> - Safe — your research is stored safely for the future in CERN’s Data Centre for as long as CERN exists.
> - Trusted — built and operated by CERN and OpenAIRE to ensure that everyone can join in Open Science.
> - Citeable — every upload is assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), to make them citable and trackable.
No waiting time — Uploads are made available online as soon as you hit publish, and your DOI is registered within seconds.
> - Open or closed — Share e.g. anonymized clinical trial data with only medical professionals via our restricted access mode.
> - Versioning — Easily update your dataset with our versioning feature.
> - GitHub integration — Easily preserve your GitHub repository in Zenodo.
> - Usage statistics — All uploads display standards compliant usage statistics
