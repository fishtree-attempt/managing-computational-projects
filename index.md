<p>The <strong>Data Science for Biomedical Scientists</strong> project is funded by The Alan Turing Institute’s <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/asg">AI for Science and Government</a> (ASG) Research Programme.
This training material covers best practices for managing and supervising computational projects in biology and related fields.
Although the training course is tailored to the biomedical sciences community, materials will be generally transferable and directly relevant for data science projects across different domains.</p>
<p>Pulling together existing training materials, infrastructure support and domain expertise from <a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/">The Turing Way</a>, <a href="https://carpentries.org/">The Carpentries</a>, <a href="https://openlifesci.org/">Open Life Science</a> and the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/omics-data-generation-and-analysis-group">Turing ‘omics interest group</a>, we aim to design and deliver a resource that is accessible and comprehensible for the biomedical and wet-lab biology researchers.</p>
<p>All materials are developed online openly under CC-BY 4.0 License using The Carpentries training format and The Carpentries Incubator lesson infrastructure.
Anyone interested in collaboration and improvements of this material is welcome to connect with the development team on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/managing-computational-projects">see the repository</a>) or contact <em>The Turing Way</em> team who are leading this project by emailing <a href="mailto:theturingway@gmail.com">theturingway@gmail.com</a>.</p>

> ## Prerequisites
>
> This resources is designed for experimental biologists and biomedical research communities, with a focus on two key professional/career groups:
> * Group leaders without prior experience with Data Science and ML/AI - interested in understanding the potential additionality and application in their areas of expertise
> * Postdoc/Lab scientists – next-generation senior leaders - interested in additionality, but also the group more likely to benefit from tools to equip them with the requirements to enable the integration of computational science into biosciences
>
> In defining the scope of this project for our target audience, we make the following assumptions about the learner groups, which can be considered pre-requisites for this training:
>
> * Our learners have a good understanding of designing or contributing to a scientific project throughout its lifecycle
> * They have identified a computational project with specific questions that will help them reflect on the skills, practices and technical concepts discussed in this training
> * This training doesn't cover processes of designing a research proposal, managing grant/funding or evaluating ethical considerations for research. However, we assume that learners have a computational project in mind for which funding and research ethics have been approved and comprehensive documentation capturing this information is available to share with the research team.
> We also assume that the research team of any size is (either partially or fully) established.
