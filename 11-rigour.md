After you have decided how to collect your data, analyze it and which tools to use, a good way to document these decisions is by writing a [Registered Report](https://support.jmir.org/hc/en-us/articles/360003450852-What-is-a-Registered-Report-).
A Registered Report highlights the importance of the research question and the methods that will be used.
They are peer-reviewed before the research, switching the focus of the review from the results to the substance of the research methods.
